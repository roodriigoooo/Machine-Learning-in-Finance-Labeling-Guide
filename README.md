# Machine-Learning-in-Finance-Exploration 

## Project Overview

This repository is a collection of concepts and their practical implementation from the ML Applied to Finance field, inspired mainly by key literature and recent prominent works such as *Advances in Financial Machine Learning* and *Artificial Intelligence in AI* by **Marcos LÃ³pez de Prado** and **Yves Hilpisch**. 

## Project Goals 

1. Understand and Apply: Learn key ML techniques and their peculiarities when they are applied to finance. Replicate the implementations proposed by the available literature.

2. Re-explain and Improve: Provide more digestible yet detailed explanations for each concept, while suggesting improvements or modifications when appropriate.

3. Explore New Frameworks: Offer alternative implementations using frameworks like **PyTorch** and other non-commonly used frameworks in the domain of finance.

4. Real-life Applications: Apply the explored concepts to real-world financial scenarios to demonstrate practical value.

## Projects

1. Labeling in Finance: A Guide.
2. Asset Allocation Using Machine Learning: Hierarchical Risk Parity
3. Applications of Encoded Price Series Entropy: Forecasting Market Efficiency
