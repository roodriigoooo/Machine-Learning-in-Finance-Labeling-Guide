# Machine-Learning-in-Finance-Exploration

## Project Overview

This repository is a collection of concepts and their practical implementation from the ML Applied to Finance field, inspired mainly by key literature and recent prominent works such as *Advances in Financial Machine Learning* by **Marcos López de Prado**. 

## Project Goals 

1. Understand and Apply: Learn key ML techniques and their peculiarities when they are applied to finance. Replicate the implementations proposed by the available literature.

2. Re-explain and Improve: Provide more digestible yet detailed explanations for each concept, while suggesting improvements or modifications when appropriate.

3. Explore New Frameworks: Offer alternative implementations using frameworks like **PyTorch** and other non-commonly used frameworks in the domain of finance.

4. Real-life Applications: Apply the explored concepts to real-world financial scenarios to demonstrate practical value.

## Frameworks & Tools

- **Python**
- **scikit-learn**
- **PyTorch**
- **pandas**
- **numpy**
- **matplotlib**
